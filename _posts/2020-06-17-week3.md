Initially, I planned to write the entire program for accessing the dualshock 4 data from scratch, but I decided to use libraries to finish it since the task needed to be completed relatively quickly. I found a joystick API written in C and finished writing a program in C, along with its makefile, that would output button states while making the program flexible enough to account for velocity commands later on.
