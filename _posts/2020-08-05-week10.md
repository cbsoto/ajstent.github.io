I started by looking for visualizations of Dijkstra’s algorithm. I was considering using nodes based on weight as the representation but decided that I wanted an application closer to the robots that my research group was working on. I couldn’t find any that I thought were unique enough since the goal was to go for breadth with visualizations and algorithms. I decided to go with a hexagon based visualization so that the distance to move in any of the six directions was the same. I was able to create a visualization, but the amount of time it took for me to complete it was longer than expected because the way I manipulated the squares in my A* implementation did not work for this implementation with hexagons visually speaking.
