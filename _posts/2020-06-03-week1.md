I implemented the A* algorithm with a straight-line distance heuristic in C++. The user would input a text file map and the program would output the map with the optimal route. After passing the tests I created for this program, I rewrote the program with the intent of optimizing the performance and readability of the code and added a makefile. Afterwards, I added and tested features such as allowing the user to add comments to the input text files and input checks. Finally, I added a text file with instructions on how to run the program via linux terminal.
