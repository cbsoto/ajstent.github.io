I finished implementing the Bug 0 algorithm with the simplified edge detection. I started looking for a different algorithm to implement. I was looking for an algorithm that was considered simple enough for new programmers to learn. I decided to go with Dijkstra's algorithm since it was the first algorithm most people learn and a lot of relevant algorithms are different versions of it.
