I collaborated with one of my peers named Rishi on which path planning algorithm to implement moving forward. I researched algorithms that might be worth programming with the scope of the research goal in mind. I picked the Bug 0 algorithm to start with and looked for common visualizations of the algorithm with respect to learning. I started working on its implementation in Julia.
