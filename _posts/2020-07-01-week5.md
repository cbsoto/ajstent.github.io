I searched for and found a C++ library for the dualshock 4 data and reprogrammed the visualization code for it in C++ using the new joystick library. I started figuring out how to use Lightweight Communications and Marshalling (LCM) with C++ with the intention of integrating it with the program I wrote for the dualshock 4 data.
