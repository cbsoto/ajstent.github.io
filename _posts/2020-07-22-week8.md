I continued to work on the Bug 0 algorithm implementation and finished the visualization. I was implementing edge detection, and it was not working. The problem was that I wanted to have the edge be any shape including a circle and also had something to do with where the bug would and could move in my program. By the end of the week, I looked for types of edge detection methods and compared them to my implementation. I ended up going with a simpler implementation that was compatible with my bugâ€™s movement and square edges.
