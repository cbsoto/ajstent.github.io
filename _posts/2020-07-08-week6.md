I started working on integrating Lightweight Communications and Marshalling (LCM) for the dualshock 4 data. I ran into the problem of distinguishing axes commands versus button commands when using LCM. I learned about the capability of using multiple channels via LCM, made a button and axis channel, and finished integrating LCM with the dualshock 4.
