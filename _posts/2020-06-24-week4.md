I looked for visual representations of the A* algorithm with regards to teaching and found a visual representation that I saw when I learned about A*. I took the visualization and recreated it in the programming language Julia. I applied the algorithm to the representation while allowing flexibility for other algorithms to be programmed and tested against the visualization.
